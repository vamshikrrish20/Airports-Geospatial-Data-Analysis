# Airports Geospatial Data Analysis Using PostgreSQL and PostGIS - DBMS PROJECT

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the Airport Geospatial Data Analysis project, completed as part of Database Management Systems Project at Pace University. We utilized extensive geospatial data from OurAirports, along with PostgreSQL and the PostGIS extension, to perform advanced spatial queries and manipulations.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed geospatial information for airports globally and is sourced from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/). This data comprises airport identifiers, types, coordinates, and additional attributes, all provided in a CSV format.

## Features

- **PostGIS Extension**: Integration of PostgreSQL's extension for managing spatial data.
- **Spatial Queries**: Complex SQL queries to process and analyze geospatial information.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and insights into global airport locations using advanced database queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use of indexing and advanced SQL techniques to optimize data retrieval.


### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL
- PostGIS extension
